### Design Architecture

1. **MVVM Pattern**:
    - **ViewModel**: Design your ViewModel to hold and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It should be responsible for making calls to the Repository layer and handling any business logic.
    - **Repository Layer**: This layer will interact with your web service API. It acts as a mediator between the ViewModel and the data source (your backend).

2. **LiveData or StateFlow**:
    - Decide whether to use LiveData or Kotlin's StateFlow to handle data observability and UI state management. StateFlow is a newer API that is fully integrated with Kotlin's coroutines.

3. **Dependency Injection**:
    - Consider using a dependency injection framework like Hilt or Koin for better scalability and testability.

4. **Navigation**:
    - Plan how navigation will be handled in your app. With Jetpack Compose, you can use the `NavController` for managing composable screens.

5. **Data Models**:
    - Define data models corresponding to your web service's data structure for users, transactions, fund sources, etc.

6. **Handling State**:
    - Determine how to handle and store the UI state effectively, especially for complex UIs or data-driven screens.

### Implement User Authentication

1. **Login UI**:
    - Design a composable function for the login screen, ensuring it aligns with your app’s aesthetic.
    - Include input fields for username/email and password, and a button to submit the login request.

2. **Integration with Backend**:
    - Use Retrofit or another HTTP client to make requests to your web service for authentication.
    - Handle the reception of JWT tokens and securely store them, possibly using encrypted shared preferences.

3. **Secure Storage**:
    - Store the received JWT tokens securely. You can use Android’s EncryptedSharedPreferences or a secure library like Hawk.

4. **Error Handling**:
    - Implement error handling for scenarios like invalid credentials or network issues.

5. **Navigation upon Login**:
    - Upon successful login, navigate the user to the main screen of the app using the `NavController`.

6. **Signup and Password Recovery**:
    - Optionally, if your API supports it, include signup and password recovery options.

7. **ViewModel for Authentication**:
    - Implement a ViewModel for handling authentication logic and maintaining authentication state.
